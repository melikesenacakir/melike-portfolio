I have a strong interest in research, creative problem solving, and software design.\n\n Currently, I am an active member of the Software Development Unit in the Siber Vatan Yavuzlar Web Security & Development Team, focusing on backend development responsibilities. In this team, I participate on a voluntary basis, learn and grow through a mentor-mentee relationship, and collaborate with the team to develop many projects.\n\n I continuously enhance my knowledge in Go for backend development and Angular for frontend development, building projects using these technologies. Additionally, I am advancing my proficiency in .NET and React by developing various projects. You can access the projects I have developed so far from the projects section and my Github account.\n\n With a solid understanding of security vulnerabilities, I constantly push myself forward to ensure that my projects are developed securely."
